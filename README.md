Building a cryptocurrency

### Future Considerations/ TODO's
1. Have the clear transactions method only clear a subset and not the entire pool.
2. Implement transaction fees that are used as part of a miner's reward.
3. Make the blockchain's reward wallet inaccessible to others.
4. Build a basic frontend or maybe electron desktop app for the wallet, etc.
